            "Square Enix recently released a helpful patch for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth that ushered in a litany of quality-of-life improvements, including a fix for a Platinum Trophy-breaking bug. One unmentioned hero Rebirth’s recent changes is a subtle yet effective rewording of its final battle’s game over screen that had players mistakenly restart the entire encounter from the beginning. Rebirth, like Final Fantasy VII: Remake, has a progressively difficult multiphase final battle boss run. Players who clicked Retry from This Battle, assuming it would spit them out moments before their untimely deaths, were instead sent to the start of the final boss run — effectively negating upwards of an hour of hard work players put in to get to where. This caused players to storm online forum pages with posts pointing out that the correct retry option — in this case, “Retry from Before Current Battle” — was worded in such an unnecessarily contrived way that they were doomed from the start. It would appear that this gamer headache is now a thing of the past. Players on the r/FFVIIRemake subreddit spotted a much more straightforward change to Rebirth’s final game-over screen. Now, the top option reads “Retry from Current Phase.” Folks celebrated the unceremonious menu change, lauding Square Enix for paying attention to the community’s upheaval over it while sharing anecdotal tales about how misclicking the final boss menu led to them rage-quitting. In our review, we wrote: Final Fantasy VII Rebirth impressively builds off of what Remake set in motion, both as a best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenges and an awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long.",

        title: 'X-Mens 97',

            "It’s safe to say a great many Marvel fans are still reeling from the events of X-Men ‘97’s fifth episode. The series takes a profoundly dark turn in “Remember It,” with Magneto, Rogue and Gambit defending the mutant nation of Genosha from a rampaging Master Mold Sentinel. By the time the battle is over, Magneto and Gambit are dead, along with countless other inhabitants of the new mutant nation. X-Men ‘97 has just killed off two of its most iconic and beloved characters, and we’re only halfway through Season 1. Clearly, the new series isn’t afraid to break a few toys in service of telling a good story. To learn more about the challenges of crafting this bleak episode and killing off fan-favorite heroes from the original X-Men: The Animated Series, IGN spoke to X-Men ‘97 supervising director Jake Castorena and episodic directors Chase Coney and Emi Yonemura. Read on to learn how X-Men ‘97 is bringing a new level of consequences to this long-running animated universe. Episode 5 is very much a turning point for the series. Up until that point, X-Men ‘97 carried a more hopeful tone, suggesting that mutants were finally beginning to win acceptance in a world that once hated and feared them. That optimism comes crashing down in the climax of “Remember It,” which serves as a sobering reminder that there are some who will stop at nothing less than the complete annihilation of mutantkind. Castorena echoes recent comments made by former showrunner Beau DeMayo, who compared the massacre on Genosha to the experience of living through real-world tragedies like 9/11 and the Pulse club shooting. “It was one of the things that initially intrigued me about coming onto the project and realizing where things were going, where we were taking the show,” Castorena tells IGN. “It's important to acknowledge, and again, this comes from the mission statement from those visions from day one, there is a certain generation that grew up with the original X-Men show. That certain generation, anyone who's grown up with the X-Men series, has … lived through an experience … as a people: loss of innocence, so to speak, on a global level, on a fundamental level, 9/11, all the way down to COVID and everything that's happened in between and after.”Castorena continues, “For those of us that grew up with that show, we're understanding that there is a world and that world has consequences. That's what intrigued me about this project. [It] was, ‘Oh, there are consequences on this show. Case in point - death.’ It's always a really big swing to want to change or modify something from its original DNA. There weren't really deaths in the original show. Yes, Morph died, but Morph came back. People died, but they always came back. They always got up. They were down, but they were never out. They always healed and came back. We lost them for an episode or two.” As Yonemura explains, part of the challenge of Episode 5 is ensuring that the series earns its big moments and sells the horrific tragedy unfolding before our eyes.",

            "Dragon's Dogma 2 is a wacky puzzle of a game, full of secrets and interactions that were still surprising players weeks after launch. And while it seems like most of its major twists have already been uncovered, one player claims they've found an obscure Dragon's Dogma 2 secret that's taking them to previously unexplored parts of the game's map. In the final hours of Dragon's Dogma 2's true ending, players are transported to a bizarre place known as the Unmoored World. There, an advancing red fog representative of the murderous Brine slowly creeps across the land, consuming more and more of the map until either the player stops it or the game ends. Players already have some wild theories about what's going on with the Unmoored World, the characters in it, and what's really happening here. But it all got weirder a few days ago, when someone seemingly managed to walk into the red fog and explore what lies beyond, unscathed. Reddit user Temporary-Class3803 claims in a post to the Dragon's Dogma 2 subreddit that they've found a way to safely traverse the red fog. Per their post, they were initially just exploring theories on how to reverse the fog's encroachment, something that is currently thought impossible. But while they were experimenting, they found an area where Capcom seemingly forgot to code in the Brine consumes you now functionality, allowing them to just walk into the giant fog sea and wander around. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like you can actually do much in the big cloud of fog. The Unmoored World is effectively a mirror of the real one in most ways, with the red fog starting where the ocean used to be and slowly eating up the map. As a result, most of what's inside the fog cloud just seems to be...nothing. They report trying to walk to Melve and being unable to do so without Brine eventually consuming them. Still, even if all this just seems to be an unintended goof, Temporary-Class3803 is continuing their exploration in hopes of finding more secrets in the Unmoored World. They're digging into lore, examining the many strange, caved in archways around the continent and pouring over notes and lines left by the Harve Village hermit, looking for unfound secrets. Even if it's unlikely their search turns up any fruit at this stage, the hunt itself has other Redditors curious about secrets, lore, and the potential for either cut content or future DLC content. The primary running theory at the moment (which Temporary-Class3803 is trying to dig into) is that there might be something to do in the Unmoored World with a number of mysterious, caved-in archways dotted around the map. It's been pointed out that at least a few of these archways are only accessible in the Unmoored World, but so far, no one's been able to figure out what they're for. Could they be entrances to a secret dungeon? Possible DLC content? Triggers for another ending? Even if Temporary-Class3803's exploration into the red fog itself is unrelated, their stumbling into it triggered a number of individuals to give the archways a second look. If there's a secret to be found there, the community is on the case.",

            "Henry Cavill took down all manner of monster in Netflix's The Witcher, but his swordsmanship will apparently be much better in the upcoming Highlander reboot. Speaking at Lionsgate's CinemaCon 2024 presentation, Cavill promised fans his swordfighting abilities would be on a new level in Highlander, which hits theatres in 2026. 'If you thought you’d seen me do swordwork before, you haven't seen anything yet,' Cavill said of his incoming performance. While the intense action of Man of Steel and his other Superman films didn't involve much sword swinging, The Witcher series featured plenty of Cavill cutting through baddies. Cavill reiterated past comments that he's a big fan of the original films for better or worse, though said his iteration, which is directed by John Wick director Chad Stahelski, will put a greater focus on franchise lore. 'They just touched on the lore in the first few movies,' Cavill said. 'We're going deeper with the lore and characters.' The actor recently said his preperation for the film would include 'a very long training process' and filming is due to begin soon too. It's centred around Scottish warrior Connor MacLeod, who discovers he is immortal when he survives what should have been a fatal stabbing in battle. It's not too surprising to see Cavill's commitment to Highlander, especially considering Lionsgate has indicated it's interested in making it a new franchise. In January, the studio announced that it signed a deal with Stahelski to give him creative oversight over both the John Wick and Highlander franchises.
