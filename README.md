# Projects
This repository contains all the projects I have participated in, some of which are course assignments, while others are my personal practical demos.

If you find an API of a project is invalid, please let me know and I will figure it out. You can contact me through my email: edenlzh@outlook.com

Hope these projects can help you well.ðŸ˜Ž
