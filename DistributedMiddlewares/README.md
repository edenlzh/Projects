# Distributed System Simulation
This project contains a network and 5 middlewares to simulate a distributed system which each clinet has an individual delay time to communicate with the server 
in a local machine. The network will boardcast all messages it received. Each application has its own GUI to show messages they receive and all the 5 middlewares 
must finally display all the messages in a same order.
